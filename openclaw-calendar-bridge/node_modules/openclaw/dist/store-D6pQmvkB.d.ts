 * This is the read-side counterpart to saveMediaBuffer and is used by the
 * agent runner to hydrate opaque `media://inbound/<id>` URIs written by the
 * Gateway's claim-check offload path.
 *
 * Security:
 * - Rejects IDs and subdirs containing path traversal, absolute paths, empty
 *   segments, or null bytes to prevent path injection outside the media root.
 * - Verifies the resolved path is a regular file (not a symlink or directory)
 *   before returning it, matching the write-side MEDIA_FILE_MODE policy.
 *
 * @param id      The media ID as returned by SavedMedia.id (may include
 *                extension and original-filename prefix,
 *                e.g. "photo---<uuid>.png" or "图片---<uuid>.png").
 * @param subdir  The subdirectory the file was saved into (default "inbound").
 * @returns       Absolute path to the file on disk.
 * @throws        If the ID is unsafe, the file does not exist, or is not a
 *                regular file.
 *
 * Prefer readMediaBuffer when the caller needs the bytes; this path-returning
 * helper is for channel surfaces that need a stable local attachment path.
