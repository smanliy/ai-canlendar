//#region src/gateway/auth-rate-limit.d.ts
/**
 * In-memory sliding-window rate limiter for gateway authentication attempts.
 *
 * Tracks failed auth attempts by {scope, clientIp}. A scope lets callers keep
 * independent counters for different credential classes (for example, shared
 * gateway token/password vs device-token auth) while still sharing one
 * limiter instance.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - Pure in-memory Map – no external dependencies; suitable for a single
 *   gateway process. The Map is periodically pruned and capped to avoid
 *   unbounded growth.
 * - Loopback addresses (127.0.0.1 / ::1) are exempt by default so that local
 *   CLI sessions are never locked out.
 * - The module is side-effect-free: callers create an instance via
 *   {@link createAuthRateLimiter} and pass it where needed.
