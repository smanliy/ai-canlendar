* NOT trigger fresh plugin installs that race with the in-flight package
* manager activity. Configured plugin repair is deferred to the post-core
* convergence pass.
*
* If post-core convergence is also set, treat the call as post-core
* convergence (post-core wins). This lets a parent process re-enter doctor
* with both flags set and still get repair behavior.

* NOTE: only consumers that route through this helper observe the

* `commands/doctor-repair-mode.ts`, `commands/doctor.e2e-harness.ts`,
* `flows/doctor-health-contributions.ts`) treat both flags as
* "update-in-progress". This is intentional: those paths are control-flow
* gates (skip warnings, skip checks, e2e shims) where update-in-progress
* suppression is still the correct behavior even mid-convergence. Migrate
* a direct reader only when its semantics genuinely diverge between the
* two phases.
